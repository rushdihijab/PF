            <span>Movie app</span> is a web app developed using the MERN stack that provides users with access to information about movies, directors, and genres. Users can create an account, update their personal data, and create a list of favorite movies.

        <h2>Purpose &amp; Context</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Movie app</span> was a personal project I built as part of my web development course at CareerFoundry to demonstrate my mastery of full-stack JavaScript development.

        <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            The aim of the project was to have an ambitious full-stack project that I can add to my professional portfolio. The problem I wanted to solve is to build the complete server-side and client-side for the application from scratch.

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <div class="server-side">
          <h3>Server-Side</h3>
          <p>
            I created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, which interacts with a non-relational database (MongoDB). The API can be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET or POST. CRUD methods are used to retrieve and store data in the database. The API provides movie information in JSON format.

            <img src="img/3.png" class="profileProjectImg" alt="Screenshot of movie list">
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="client-side">
          <h3>Client-Side</h3>
          <p>
            After completing the API, I started building the interface users would need when making requests to and receiving responses from the server-side. It is a single-page, responsive application developed with React and React-Redux. It provides several interface views, including a main view (shows a list of all movies), single movie view (shows data about a single movie and allows users to add the movie to their list of favorites), a login view, a registration view, and a profile view (where users can update their user data and list of favorites).

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          This was both my favorite and most challenging project. I enjoyed building the API and working with database structures. I also quickly became familiar with using the terminal. When developing the client-side, it took me a while to understand how React and Redux work and how to achieve the desired results. But with the help of my great tutor and after a pair-programming session with an experienced developer, I conquered that mountain.
